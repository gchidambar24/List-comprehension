# List-comprehension
If we use list comprehension in our code if possible then it will greatly optimises the code and increases the speed of execution
Here I am going to take a example which i have solved in three different
going from conventional methosd of for loop to the list comprehension which will give you the idea about how we can solve the problems very easily with list comprehension


Problem statment which I have taken from Solo-Learn and I am posting it here as it is

You are analyzing sales data from a ticket office.The ticket for an adult is $20, while the ticket for a child under 18 is $5.
The data you are given is in a dictionary format, where the keys are the sold ticket numbers, and the values are the customer ages.
For example, "123-08": 24 means that the ticket having randoom number "123-08" was bought by  a 24 year old person

Your goal is to calculate how much more money the office would make if it would change the ticket discount age from 18  to some lower age given as input to program .
So, your program needs to take an integer as input and output the percentage of revenue growth, if the discount was given to people under that age.

For example, if the office made $15000 with the original discount age 18 , and would make $18000 with new age 14 as the discount age, then the growth would be ((18000-15000)/15000)*100 = 20%

So, for the input 14, your program should output 20. 
The output should be an integer
